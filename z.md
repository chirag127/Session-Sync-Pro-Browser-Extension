# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Session Sync Pro Browser Extension

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Author:** [Your Name/AI Prompt]
**Agent:** AI Development Agent

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Session Sync Pro

**Goal:** To create a browser extension that enables users to easily save, manage, and restore complete web sessions (including cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`) for specific websites. The extension will feature user accounts (sign up/sign in via email/password) to facilitate the synchronization of saved sessions across multiple devices, ensuring data persistence and accessibility.

**Problem Statement:** Users often need to manage multiple accounts (e.g., work, personal, testing) on the same website. Constantly logging out and back in is time-consuming and inefficient. Existing browser profile features can be cumbersome, and password managers don't typically handle full session states, including `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. This extension aims to provide a one-click solution for switching between saved sessions for specific websites.

**Vision:** To become the go-to browser extension for users who need seamless switching between different sessions on the same website, offering a secure (within defined parameters) and user-friendly experience with cross-device synchronization.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Simplify Multi-Account Management:** Reduce the friction and time spent logging in and out of different accounts on the same website.
*   **Enhance Productivity:** Allow developers, testers, and power users to switch contexts quickly.
*   **Provide Cross-Device Consistency:** Enable users to access their saved sessions from any device where they are logged into the extension.
*   **Ensure User Control:** Give users clear options for saving, naming, restoring, and managing their sessions.
*   **Deliver a Reliable Service:** Build a stable and performant extension and backend system.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Web Developers & Testers:** Need to test websites with various user roles, permissions, and data states.
*   **Social Media Managers:** Manage multiple client or personal accounts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
*   **Freelancers & Consultants:** Access client accounts on various platforms without conflicting with their own sessions.
*   **General Power Users:** Anyone frequently switching between multiple logins (e.g., personal/work Google accounts, different shopping site accounts).

## 4. Core Features and Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Technology Stack & Project Structure

*   **FR1.1 (P0): Extension Frontend:**
    *   Technology: Browser Extension (Manifest V3) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    *   No specific JS framework mandated, use vanilla JS or a lightweight library suitable for extensions if needed.
    *   Ensure compatibility with major Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) and Firefox (consider potential API differences).
*   **FR1.2 (P0): Backend:**
    *   Technology: Node.js with Express.js framework.
    *   Database: MongoDB.
    *   Purpose: User authentication, storing user data, and storing/syncing saved session data.
*   **FR1.3 (P0): Project Structure:**
    *   Create a monorepo or clearly separated directories:
        *   `extension/`: Contains all code for the browser extension (manifest.json, popup, background scripts, content scripts, assets, etc.).
        *   `backend/`: Contains all code for the Express.js server and database interaction logic.
    *   Structure code within each directory modularly (e.g., separate modules/files for auth, session handling, UI components, API routes, database models).
*   **FR1.4 (P0): Documentation & Maintainability:**
    *   Code must be well-commented, explaining complex logic.
    *   Follow consistent coding standards (e.g., ESLint/Prettier configuration).
    *   Provide a README.md in both `extension/` and `backend/` directories explaining setup, build, and deployment steps.
    *   Ensure the architecture facilitates future maintenance and potential feature additions.

### 4.2 Session Saving

*   **FR2.1 (P0): Session Definition:** A "session" encompasses all relevant data needed to replicate the user's state on a specific website. This includes:
    *   Cookies (associated with the *exact* domain).
    *   `localStorage` entries for the origin.
    *   `sessionStorage` entries for the origin.
*   **FR2.2 (P0): Saving Trigger:** Users must manually initiate the saving process.
    *   A "Save Current Session" button/option shall be available within the extension's browser action popup when the user is actively viewing a website tab.
    *   A "Save Current Session for this Site" option shall be available in the context menu when the user right-clicks on a webpage.
*   **FR2.3 (P0): Session Scope:** Sessions are saved for the *specific origin* (protocol + hostname + port) of the currently active tab. For example, a session saved on `https://app.example.com:8080` is distinct from `https://www.example.com`. It does *not* apply to the entire base domain (`*.example.com`).
*   **FR2.4 (P0): Session Naming:** Upon triggering "Save Session", the user must be prompted to provide a custom, meaningful name for the session (e.g., "Admin Account", "Test User - Feature X", "Personal Login").
    *   Provide a default suggestion (e.g., Website Name + Timestamp), but allow easy overriding.
    *   Validate the name (e.g., non-empty, reasonable length limit).
*   **FR2.5 (P0): Data Capture:** When saving, the extension must:
    *   Use the `chrome.cookies.getAll` API (or equivalent) to retrieve all cookies matching the current tab's URL's domain.
    *   Execute content scripts (if necessary, using appropriate permissions) to access and retrieve the current state of `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for the page's origin.
    *   Package the captured cookies, `localStorage` data (as key-value pairs), and `sessionStorage` data (as key-value pairs) along with the session name, website URL (origin), and potentially a timestamp and favicon URL.
*   **FR2.6 (P1): Handling HttpOnly Cookies during Save:**
    *   The extension *can* retrieve metadata about `HttpOnly` cookies (like name, domain, path) using `chrome.cookies.getAll`. However, it *cannot* read their `value`.
    *   When saving, store all retrievable cookie information (including non-HttpOnly values and metadata for HttpOnly ones).
    *   **Crucially:** Do *not* attempt to guess or infer HttpOnly cookie values. Store exactly what the API provides. The limitation lies in reading, not setting during restore.
*   **FR2.7 (P0): Local Storage (Logged Out / Offline):** If the user is not logged in or the backend is unreachable, the saved session data (name, URL, cookies, storage data) must be stored securely within the browser's extension storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
*   **FR2.8 (P0): Cloud Storage (Logged In):** If the user is logged in and the backend is reachable, the saved session data must be sent to the backend API for persistent storage and synchronization. Trigger sync immediately after a successful local save.
*   **FR2.9 (P0): Save Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user upon successful save (e.g., "Session '[Session Name]' saved for [Website Name]") or failure (e.g., "Failed to save session. Error: [details]").

### 4.3 Session Restoration

*   **FR3.1 (P0): Restoration Trigger:** Users initiate restoration from the extension's interface.
    *   The browser action popup will list saved sessions. Each session will have a "Restore" button.
    *   The context menu (when on a webpage) could potentially list sessions *relevant to the current site* with a "Restore" option.
*   **FR3.2 (P0): Pre-Restoration Check:** Before restoring a session for Website X:
    *   The user should ideally navigate to Website X first. The extension UI might guide them or enable restoration directly, but the target tab for restoration must be identified.
    *   Check if the user is *already* logged in or has an active session on Website X in the target tab.
*   **FR3.3 (P0): Overwrite Confirmation:** If an active session (detected by the presence of relevant cookies/storage for the domain) exists in the target tab, **prompt the user**: "Restoring '[Saved Session Name]' will replace your current session on [Website Name]. Do you want to continue? [Yes/Replace] [No/Cancel]".
*   **FR3.4 (P0): Restoration Process:** Upon confirmation (or if no existing session was detected):
    *   Retrieve the target saved session data (from local storage or fetched from the backend if not available locally).
    *   **Clear Existing Data:** Remove all existing cookies, `localStorage` entries, and `sessionStorage` entries for the target website's origin in the active tab. Use `chrome.cookies.remove` and content scripts for storage clearance.
    *   **Set Saved Data:**
        *   Use `chrome.cookies.set` to add each saved cookie. This can set `HttpOnly` cookies even though their values couldn't be read during save, *provided* the necessary metadata (domain, path, name, secure, etc.) was saved correctly.
        *   Execute content scripts to populate `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` with the saved key-value pairs.
*   **FR3.5 (P1): Handling HttpOnly Cookies during Restore:**
    *   The success of restoring `HttpOnly` cookies depends on whether the critical session identifier was among them *and* if the server accepts the session based solely on setting these known cookies.
    *   The extension should attempt to set *all* saved cookies using the `chrome.cookies.set` API.
    *   If restoration appears successful but the user isn't logged in, it might be due to HttpOnly limitations or other server-side checks. The extension cannot fully guarantee success due to this browser security feature.
*   **FR3.6 (P0): Post-Restoration Action:** After attempting to restore the session data:
    *   **Prompt the user**: "Session restored. Reload the page for changes to take full effect? [Reload Now] [Reload Later]".
    *   Do *not* automatically reload the page without user confirmation.
*   **FR3.7 (P0): Restoration Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback:
    *   Success: "Session '[Session Name]' restored for [Website Name]. Please reload the page."
    *   Failure: "Failed to restore session. Error: [details]." (e.g., Cannot access tab, failed to clear storage).
*   **FR3.8 (P1): Session Expiration Handling:**
    *   The extension primarily stores session *data*, not validity status.
    *   If a user restores an old session whose server-side counterpart has expired, the website itself will handle the invalid session (e.g., redirect to login).
    *   **Notification:** When a user *attempts* to restore a session, if the extension can detect (e.g., based on cookie expiry dates *if available and reliable*, which often isn't the case for session cookies) or if a restore fails implicitly (user still not logged in after reload), *notify* the user: "This saved session might be expired or invalid. You may need to log in again on [Website Name]." Provide an option to easily delete the potentially invalid saved session.

### 4.4 User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)

*   **FR4.1 (P0): Interaction Points:**
    *   **Browser Action Popup:** Primary interface. Accessed by clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
    *   **Context Menu:** Right-click menu on web pages. Provides quick access to save/restore actions relevant to the current page.
*   **FR4.2 (P0): Popup UI - Logged Out:**
    *   "Sign Up" button.
    *   "Sign In" button.
    *   List of locally saved sessions (if any), grouped by website.
    *   "Save Current Session" button (active only when on a valid web page).
*   **FR4.3 (P0): Popup UI - Logged In:**
    *   Display User Identifier (e.g., email).
    *   "Log Out" button.
    *   "Sync Status" indicator (e.g., "Synced", "Syncing...", "Offline").
    *   List of all saved sessions (local + synced), grouped by website.
    *   "Save Current Session" button.
    *   Potentially a search bar to filter saved sessions (P1).
*   **FR4.4 (P0): Session List Display:**
    *   Group sessions by website URL (origin).
    *   For each website group, list the saved sessions by their custom names.
    *   Display the website's Favicon next to the website name/group heading for easy identification. Fetch and cache favicons.
    *   Each session entry should show:
        *   Custom Session Name.
        *   "Restore" button.
        *   "Delete" button.
        *   (P1) Maybe "Edit Name" button.
        *   (P1) Maybe a timestamp ("Saved on [Date]").
*   **FR4.5 (P0): Context Menu UI:**
    *   When right-clicking on a page:
        *   "Session Sync Pro" parent menu item.
        *   Sub-menu: "Save Current Session for [Website Name]"
        *   Sub-menu (if sessions exist for the current site): "Restore Session for [Website Name]" -> List of saved session names for *this specific site*. Clicking a name triggers restore.
        *   Sub-menu: "Manage All Sessions" (opens popup).
*   **FR4.6 (P0): Feedback Mechanisms:** Use clear, non-intrusive notifications (e.g., temporary banners within the popup, or subtle browser notifications if appropriate) for success and error messages related to saving, restoring, syncing, login, logout.
*   **FR4.7 (P1): Whitelist/Blacklist:**
    *   Provide a settings page accessible from the popup.
    *   Allow users to add specific website domains (e.g., `example.com`, `*.google.com`) to a blacklist.
    *   The extension should not offer save/restore options (popup button disabled, context menu items hidden) on blacklisted sites.
    *   Alternatively, use a whitelist approach if preferred (only operate on explicitly whitelisted sites). Define the default behavior (operate everywhere except blacklist).

### 4.5 Authentication & Synchronization

*   **FR5.1 (P0): Authentication Method:**
    *   Support Sign Up and Sign In using **Email and Password only**.
    *   Implement standard email verification for sign-up (send a verification link).
    *   Implement password reset functionality (send password reset link to email).
*   **FR5.2 (P0): Auth Interface:**
    *   Sign Up / Sign In forms will *not* be directly in the popup.
    *   The "Sign Up" and "Sign In" buttons in the popup will open a new tab or a dedicated extension page containing the respective forms (Email, Password, Confirm Password for sign-up).
*   **FR5.3 (P0): Backend User Storage:**
    *   Store user credentials securely in the MongoDB database.
    *   **Password Hashing:** Passwords MUST be hashed using a strong, salted algorithm like `bcrypt`. Store only the hash, not the plaintext password.
*   **FR5.4 (P0): Backend Session Data Storage:**
    *   Create a MongoDB collection to store saved session data linked to user accounts.
    *   Schema should include fields like `userId`, `sessionName`, `websiteUrl`, `websiteFaviconUrl`, `savedAt`, `cookieData`, `localStorageData`, `sessionStorageData`.
*   **FR5.5 (P0 - WITH SECURITY WARNING): Data Encryption at Rest:**
    *   **Requirement:** As specified, session data (`cookieData`, `localStorageData`, `sessionStorageData`) **will NOT be encrypted** at rest in the MongoDB database.
    *   **WARNING:** This is a major security risk. If the database is compromised, all saved session cookies and storage data will be exposed in plaintext, potentially allowing attackers to hijack user sessions on target websites. This decision must be clearly communicated to end-users in the Privacy Policy.
*   **FR5.6 (P0): Data Encryption in Transit:** All communication between the browser extension and the backend API MUST use HTTPS to encrypt data during transit. Configure the Express.js server for HTTPS only.
*   **FR5.7 (P0): Synchronization Trigger:** Syncing occurs automatically:
    *   When a user logs in (fetch all sessions from backend).
    *   When a user saves a new session while logged in (push new session to backend).
    *   When a user deletes a session while logged in (send delete request to backend).
    *   When a user restores a session (potentially fetch latest version from backend if unsure about local copy freshness, though saving triggers sync).
*   **FR5.8 (P0): Offline Mode & Sync Resolution:**
    *   Users MUST be able to save, view, restore, and delete sessions stored *locally* even when offline or logged out.
    *   When the user comes online and logs in (or is already logged in), the extension must:
        *   Fetch sessions from the backend.
        *   Compare local sessions with backend sessions (e.g., using timestamps or unique IDs).
        *   Merge the lists: Upload local-only sessions, download backend-only sessions.
        *   Handle conflicts (e.g., if a session with the same name for the same site exists both locally and remotely but with different data - prompt the user or use a 'last-saved-wins' strategy. Define the strategy - suggest 'last-saved-wins' based on timestamp).
*   **FR5.9 (P0): Data Isolation:** The backend API MUST ensure strict data isolation. A logged-in user must ONLY be able to access, modify, or delete their *own* saved session data. Implement robust authorization checks on every API endpoint based on the authenticated user's ID.

### 4.6 Security & Permissions

*   **FR6.1 (P0): Browser Permissions:** The extension `manifest.json` must declare and justify the minimal required permissions:
    *   `storage`: To store extension settings, local sessions, and user auth status.
    *   `cookies`: To read cookies from websites and to set/remove cookies during restore.
    *   `activeTab`: To get the URL of the current tab and potentially inject scripts on user action (like save/restore).
    *   `contextMenus`: To add options to the right-click menu.
    *   `scripting`: (Manifest V3) To execute scripts in the context of web pages for accessing `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` and clearing data.
    *   `host_permissions`: `<all_urls>` is required to allow the extension to read/write cookies and execute scripts on *any* website the user wants to save/restore sessions for. This is necessary for the core functionality but requires clear justification to the user during installation.
    *   `alarms`: (Optional, P1) Could be used for periodic background sync checks if needed, though on-action sync is the primary method.
*   **FR6.2 (P0): Backend Security:**
    *   Implement standard security best practices for the Express.js application:
        *   Use security middleware (e.g., Helmet.js).
        *   Validate and sanitize all input coming from the extension API requests.
        *   Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (login, sign-up, password reset) to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF - though CSRF is less relevant for API endpoints used by extensions if using token auth, ensure proper CORS configuration).
*   **FR6.3 (P0): Secure Authentication Flow:** Use secure methods for handling authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs stored securely in `chrome.storage.local`, *not* `localStorage`). Ensure tokens have reasonable expiration times and are transmitted securely (HTTPS).

### 4.7 Edge Cases & Error Handling

*   **FR7.1 (P0): Invalid User Input:** Handle invalid or missing input gracefully (e.g., empty session names, invalid email formats). Provide informative error messages.
*   **FR7.2 (P0): API Errors:** Handle potential errors during communication with the backend (network issues, server errors, authorization failures). Inform the user appropriately (e.g., "Could not sync. Server unavailable."). Maintain local state if sync fails.
*   **FR7.3 (P0): Storage Limits:** Be mindful of browser storage limits (`chrome.storage.local`). While generous, warn the user if they are approaching limits (unlikely with text data unless storing huge numbers of sessions). Consider if backend storage needs limits (specified as *no limits* per user request).
*   **FR7.4 (P0): Website Structure Changes:** Acknowledge that if a website drastically changes its login mechanism, cookie structure, or reliance on `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` after a session is saved, restoring that session may fail or not result in a logged-in state. The extension cannot predict or automatically adapt to these site-specific changes. Inform the user if restoration seems unsuccessful.
*   **FR7.5 (P0): Concurrent Extension Usage:** If the user has the extension open in multiple browser windows/profiles simultaneously and is logged into the same account, ensure synchronization logic handles potential race conditions gracefully (e.g., using timestamps, eventual consistency). The 'last save wins' approach helps here.
*   **FR7.6 (P1): Very Large Storage Data:** Consider potential performance implications if `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` on a site contains extremely large amounts of data. Implement data retrieval/setting efficiently. Maybe add a warning if saved data size is excessive.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **NFR1 (P0): Performance:**
    *   Saving and restoring sessions should feel near-instantaneous (< 1-2 seconds typically).
    *   Popup UI should load quickly.
    *   Backend API responses should be fast (< 500ms for typical operations).
    *   Extension background processes should consume minimal system resources.
*   **NFR2 (P0): Reliability:**
    *   The extension should function consistently across supported browsers.
    *   Syncing should be reliable when online. Offline mode must work robustly.
    *   Data corruption (local or backend) should be prevented through careful handling.
*   **NFR3 (P0): Security:** (See specific FRs above)
    *   HTTPS enforced for all backend communication.
    *   Passwords securely hashed (bcrypt).
    *   Robust authorization on the backend.
    *   Input validation and sanitization.
    *   Rate limiting on auth endpoints.
    *   **Explicit Acknowledgement:** Session data at rest is *not* encrypted per requirements, posing a significant risk.
*   **NFR4 (P0): Usability:**
    *   The UI should be intuitive and easy to understand.
    *   Key actions (save, restore) should be readily accessible.
    *   Feedback messages must be clear and helpful.
*   **NFR5 (P0): Maintainability:**
    *   Codebase must be modular, well-documented, and follow consistent standards.
    *   Easy to set up the development environment.
    *   Clear separation between extension and backend code.
*   **NFR6 (P1): Scalability:**
    *   The backend should be designed to handle a growing number of users and saved sessions without significant performance degradation (within reasonable limits for a typical extension audience). Consider database indexing for MongoDB.

## 6. User Stories

*   **US1 (P0):** As a web developer, I want to save the session state (cookies, local/session storage) of my application under a specific test user account with a custom name (e.g., "Admin User - Staging"), so that I can quickly restore this state later without manual login and setup.
*   **US2 (P0):** As a social media manager, I want to save my login sessions for multiple client accounts on Twitter, so that I can switch between them with one click from the extension popup.
*   **US3 (P0):** As a user with work and personal Google accounts, I want to save sessions for both accounts on `google.com`, so that I can easily switch between my work and personal contexts without logging out/in repeatedly.
*   **US4 (P0):** As a user of the extension, I want to sign up for an account using my email and password, so that my saved sessions can be synced across my different computers.
*   **US5 (P0):** As a logged-in user, I want my newly saved sessions to automatically upload to the cloud, so I can access them from another device later.
*   **US6 (P0):** As a user, I want to be prompted before restoring a session if it will overwrite my current session on that website, so I don't accidentally lose my current state.
*   **US7 (P0):** As a user, I want to see my saved sessions grouped by website and identified by favicons and custom names in the extension popup, so I can easily find the session I want to restore.
*   **US8 (P0):** As a user, I want to be able to use the core save/restore features locally even if I don't create an account or if I'm offline, so the extension is useful immediately and during network outages.
*   **US9 (P1):** As a user, I want to be notified if a restored session seems expired or invalid, so I know I might need to log in manually.
*   **US10 (P1):** As a user, I want to blacklist certain sensitive websites (like my bank), so the extension doesn't offer to save potentially risky session data for them.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (Examples)

*   **AC1 (For US1):**
    *   Given I am on `staging.myapp.com` and logged in as "Admin User".
    *   When I open the extension popup and click "Save Current Session".
    *   And I enter the name "Admin User - Staging" and confirm.
    *   Then a success message is shown.
    *   And a new session named "Admin User - Staging" associated with `staging.myapp.com` appears in the session list.
    *   And (if logged in) this session data is sent to the backend.
*   **AC2 (For US4 & US5):**
    *   Given I am not logged into the extension.
    *   When I click "Sign Up" in the popup, complete the sign-up form in the new tab, and verify my email.
    *   Then I can log in using the "Sign In" button and my credentials.
    *   And the popup now shows my email and a "Log Out" button.
    *   And any sessions I save subsequently are synced to the backend.
*   **AC3 (For US6):**
    *   Given I am logged into `website.com` with Session A.
    *   And I have a saved session named "Session B" for `website.com`.
    *   When I click "Restore" for "Session B".
    *   Then a confirmation prompt appears asking if I want to replace the current session.
    *   And if I confirm, Session A's data is cleared, Session B's data is applied, and I am prompted to reload.
    *   And if I cancel, no changes are made.
*   **AC4 (For US8):**
    *   Given I have installed the extension but have not signed up/logged in.
    *   When I save a session for `example.com`.
    *   Then the session is saved locally and appears in the popup list.
    *   And I can restore this session successfully while still logged out.
    *   And if I later sign up/log in, this locally saved session is synced to my account.

## 8. Open Issues / Future Considerations (Optional)

*   **Encryption at Rest:** Reiterate the security implications of the current requirement *not* to encrypt session data at rest. Strongly recommend revisiting this.
*   **Advanced Conflict Resolution:** Implement a more sophisticated UI for handling sync conflicts instead of just 'last-saved-wins'.
*   **Session Sharing:** Allow users to securely share specific saved sessions with other users of the extension (requires significant backend changes for permissions).
*   **Automatic Session Saving:** Option to automatically save a session upon logout detection (complex and potentially unreliable).
*   **Firefox Compatibility:** Thorough testing and potential adjustments needed for Firefox's extension APIs if full cross-browser support is a hard requirement.

## 9. Out of Scope (For Version 1.0)

*   OAuth Sign In (Google, GitHub, etc.).
*   Session sharing between users.
*   Automatic session saving/updating.
*   Browser Profile management.
*   Storing other types of data (e.g., form fill data unrelated to sessions).
*   Advanced analytics or tracking (beyond basic error reporting if implemented).
*   Import/Export functionality for saved sessions.
