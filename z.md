# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Session Sync Pro

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** [Your Name/AI Prompt]
**Target:** AI Development Agent

## 1. Overview

**1.1. Introduction:**
Session Sync Pro is a browser extension designed to enhance user productivity and workflow by allowing users to save, manage, and restore browsing sessions for specific websites. A "session" includes cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`. The extension features user authentication (Sign Up/Sign In via Email/Password) enabling the synchronization of saved sessions across multiple devices using a dedicated backend service.

**1.2. Goal:**
To create a robust, secure, and user-friendly browser extension that reliably saves and restores complete website sessions (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) on demand, with seamless cross-device synchronization for authenticated users, ultimately simplifying the management of multiple accounts or states on websites.

**1.3. Target Audience:**
*   Users managing multiple accounts (personal, work, test) on the same website (e.g., social media, web apps, development platforms).
*   Web developers and QA testers needing to switch between different user states or test scenarios quickly.
*   Anyone looking for a convenient way to preserve and resume website interactions without repeated logins or setup.

**1.4. Scope:**
*   **In Scope:**
    *   Saving sessions (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) for the current website (exact domain).
    *   Manual session saving triggered by the user.
    *   User-defined naming for saved sessions.
    *   Listing saved sessions, grouped by website, showing name and favicon/logo.
    *   Restoring saved sessions, replacing current session data for the domain.
    *   Handling session restore conflicts (prompting user if already logged in).
    *   User authentication (Email/Password Sign Up & Sign In).
    *   Synchronization of saved sessions to a backend database (MongoDB via Express.js API) for authenticated users.
    *   Offline storage and functionality (save/restore locally) with sync upon reconnection for authenticated users.
    *   Local-only functionality for unauthenticated users.
    *   Handling HttpOnly cookie limitations with user notification.
    *   User feedback messages (success/error).
    *   Option to prompt user before page reload after restore.
    *   Whitelist/Blacklist feature to disable the extension for specific websites.
    *   Password hashing and rate limiting for backend security.
    *   Interaction via browser action popup and context menu.
    *   Use of Manifest V3 for the browser extension.
    *   Modular project structure (extension/, backend/).
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Automatic session saving triggers.
    *   Saving other types of browser data (e.g., browsing history, form data beyond session/local storage).
    *   Session sharing between different users.
    *   Advanced session merging logic (only replacement is supported).
    *   Mobile application version.
    *   OAuth-based authentication (Google Sign-In, etc.).
    *   Encryption of session data *at rest* in the backend database (as per user specification, *with caveats noted below*).

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Objective 1:** Allow users to manually save the current session (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) of a specific website with a custom name via the extension interface.
*   **Objective 2:** Enable users to view their saved sessions, organized by website, and restore a selected session with a single click.
*   **Objective 3:** Implement secure user authentication (Email/Password) to allow users to access their saved sessions across different devices.
*   **Objective 4:** Synchronize saved sessions between the browser extension and a secure backend service for authenticated users upon save/restore actions.
*   **Objective 5:** Ensure the extension functions locally even when the user is offline or unauthenticated.
*   **Objective 6:** Provide clear user feedback and handle potential conflicts (e.g., restoring over an active session) gracefully.
*   **Objective 7:** Build the extension using modern web technologies (Manifest V3, JS, HTML, CSS) and a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend, following best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.

## 3. User Stories

*   **US1 (Session Saving):** As a user managing multiple accounts, I want to click a button in the extension popup while on `example.com`, name the session "Work Account", and have its cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` saved, so I can easily restore this logged-in state later.
*   **US2 (Session Listing):** As a user, I want to open the extension popup and see a list of my saved sessions, grouped by website (e.g., `example.com`, `anothersite.com`), showing the name I gave each session and the site's logo, so I can quickly find the session I need.
*   **US3 (Session Restoring):** As a user on `example.com`, I want to click the "Restore" button next to my saved "Work Account" session in the popup, so that the extension replaces my current cookies/storage with the saved ones and reloads the page (after prompting me), logging me into my work account.
*   **US4 (Conflict Handling):** As a user attempting to restore a session ("Test Account") on a site where I'm currently logged in ("Main Account"), I want the extension to ask for confirmation before proceeding and save my current "Main Account" state before restoring the "Test Account", so I don't accidentally lose my current session.
*   **US5 (Authentication):** As a user, I want to create an account using my email and password within the extension popup, so I can sync my saved sessions.
*   **US6 (Synchronization):** As an authenticated user, I want my saved sessions to automatically sync to the cloud when I save or restore them, so I can access them from my other computer where I'm also logged into the extension.
*   **US7 (Offline Access):** As a user, I want to be able to save and restore sessions even when I'm offline, so the extension remains useful without an internet connection (syncing occurs when I'm back online).
*   **US8 (Unauthenticated Use):** As a user who hasn't created an account, I want to be able to save and restore sessions locally on my current browser, so I can still benefit from the core functionality without signing up.
*   **US9 (Context Menu):** As a user browsing a website, I want to right-click on the page and select "Save Current Session" from the context menu, so I can quickly save the session without opening the main popup.
*   **US10 (Disabling Extension):** As a user, I want to add `mybank.com` to a blacklist in the extension settings, so Session Sync Pro does not interact with or save sessions for that sensitive site.
*   **US11 (HttpOnly Awareness):** As a user saving a session, if critical session cookies are HttpOnly and cannot be read, I want the extension to notify me that the saved session might be incomplete and may require manual login steps upon restore.

## 4. Core Features and Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Session Management

*   **FR1.1 (P0): Define Session Data:** The extension MUST capture cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` associated with the exact domain (e.g., `app.example.com`, not `*.example.com`) of the currently active tab when a save action is initiated.
*   **FR1.2 (P0): Manual Session Saving:**
    *   The user MUST be able to initiate a session save action via a button ("Save Current Session") within the browser action popup when visiting a website.
    *   The user MUST be able to initiate a session save action via a context menu item ("Save Session for [domain]") when right-clicking on a webpage.
*   **FR1.3 (P0): Session Naming:** Upon initiating a save action, the extension MUST prompt the user to provide a custom name for the session. A default name (e.g., domain + timestamp) MAY be suggested. The name MUST be stored alongside the session data.
*   **FR1.4 (P0): Session Storage (Local):**
    *   Saved sessions (name, domain, timestamp, cookies, localStorage data, sessionStorage data) MUST be stored locally within the browser's extension storage (e.g., `chrome.storage.local` or IndexedDB).
    *   This local storage MUST function independently of user authentication status.
*   **FR1.5 (P0): Session Listing:**
    *   The extension popup MUST display a list of all locally saved sessions.
    *   Sessions MUST be grouped by the website domain they belong to.
    *   Each listed session MUST display its user-defined name and the website's domain.
    *   The extension SHOULD attempt to fetch and display the website's favicon next to the domain grouping or session entry for easier identification.
*   **FR1.6 (P0): Session Restoration:**
    *   Each listed session MUST have a "Restore" button.
    *   When the user clicks "Restore" for a session belonging to domain `X`:
        *   The extension MUST first check if the user is currently on a page matching domain `X`. If not, it MAY prompt the user to navigate there first or offer to open the domain in a new tab and then restore (Agent to choose the best UX, prompting is safer).
        *   The extension MUST check the current session state (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) for domain `X`.
        *   **Conflict Handling:** If a potentially active session exists (e.g., non-empty cookies/storage), the extension MUST prompt the user: "You seem to have an active session. Restoring will replace it. Do you want to save the current session as '[Domain] - AutoSaved [Timestamp]' before restoring?"
            *   If the user confirms 'Yes': Trigger the save mechanism (FR1.2, FR1.3, FR1.4, FR1.8) for the *current* session with an auto-generated name, then proceed.
            *   If the user confirms 'No' (or a simpler "OK/Cancel" confirmation for restore): Proceed directly to replacement.
            *   If the user cancels: Abort the restore operation.
        *   **Data Replacement:** The extension MUST clear all existing cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` for the *exact domain* `X`.
        *   The extension MUST then set the cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` using the data from the selected saved session. Appropriate browser APIs (`cookies.set`, `storage.local.set`, executing scripts via `scripting.executeScript` for localStorage/sessionStorage) MUST be used.
*   **FR1.7 (P0): Page Reload:** After successfully restoring a session, the extension MUST prompt the user: "Session restored. Reload the page for changes to take effect?" with "Reload" and "Cancel" options. If the user clicks "Reload", the extension MUST reload the active tab.
*   **FR1.8 (P0): Synchronization Trigger:** For authenticated users, any successful Save (FR1.2) or Restore (FR1.6, only if auto-save occurred during conflict) action MUST trigger synchronization of the newly saved/updated session data to the backend (See Section 4.3). Local save MUST complete before sync is attempted.
*   **FR1.9 (P1): Handling HttpOnly Cookies:**
    *   The extension MUST request necessary permissions (`cookies`, `permissions` for host access) to read and write cookies.
    *   The extension MUST be aware that it cannot *read* the *value* of `HttpOnly` cookies using standard extension APIs.
    *   **Saving:** When saving, the extension MUST capture all accessible cookie properties (name, domain, path, secure, expirationDate, etc.), even for `HttpOnly` cookies, but the `value` will be missing/null if `HttpOnly`. The fact that a cookie is `HttpOnly` MUST be stored.
    *   **Restoring:** When restoring, the extension CAN *set* `HttpOnly` cookies (including their original name, domain, path, secure, `httpOnly=true`, etc.) using the `cookies.set` API, even if it couldn't read the value during save. It will essentially recreate the cookie structure *without* the original value if it was unreadable.
    *   **User Notification:** If, during a save operation, the extension detects potentially important session cookies marked as `HttpOnly` (heuristic: common names like `sessionid`, `JSESSIONID`, `ASP.NET_SessionId`, etc.), it SHOULD display a non-intrusive warning to the user after saving: "Session saved, but some HttpOnly cookies were detected. Restoration might require you to log in again if these contained essential session values." This message should be dismissible.
*   **FR1.10 (P1): Session Expiration Notification:**
    *   When listing saved sessions, the extension MAY visually indicate if a session contains cookies that are likely expired based on their stored `expirationDate`.
    *   If a user attempts to restore a session where key cookies are expired, the extension MAY show a warning message before proceeding: "Some cookies in this session have expired. Restoration might not log you in automatically."
*   **FR1.11 (P1): Whitelist/Blacklist:**
    *   The extension MUST provide a settings page accessible from the popup.
    *   This page MUST allow users to add domains to a "Disabled Sites" list (blacklist).
    *   If the current tab's domain is on the blacklist, the extension's icon SHOULD indicate it's inactive (e.g., grayscale), and the "Save Session" options (popup button, context menu) MUST be disabled. Session restoration for blacklisted sites from the list MUST also be disabled.

### 4.2. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)

*   **FR2.1 (P0): Browser Action Popup:**
    *   The extension MUST have a browser action button in the toolbar.
    *   Clicking the button MUST open a popup window.
    *   The popup MUST display:
        *   Sign Up / Sign In buttons (if not authenticated).
        *   User email and a Logout button (if authenticated).
        *   A "Save Current Session" button (enabled only when on a valid http/https page not on the blacklist).
        *   A list of saved sessions, grouped by domain (FR1.5).
        *   Each session entry MUST show its name and a "Restore" button.
        *   A "Settings" or gear icon linking to the settings page (for blacklist management).
    *   The popup MUST be intuitive and visually clean.
*   **FR2.2 (P0): Context Menu:**
    *   The extension MUST add a context menu item when the user right-clicks on a webpage.
    *   The menu item MUST be labeled "Session Sync Pro".
    *   It MUST contain a sub-item: "Save current session for [domain.com]" (enabled only when on a valid http/https page not on the blacklist).
*   **FR2.3 (P0): User Feedback:**
    *   The extension MUST provide clear visual feedback (e.g., temporary notification banners within the popup or using browser notifications API) for:
        *   Successful session save.
        *   Successful session restore.
        *   Errors during save/restore (e.g., permission issues, storage full, API error).
        *   Successful login/logout.
        *   Sync status (e.g., "Syncing...", "Sync complete", "Sync failed").
        *   Warnings (e.g., HttpOnly cookies detected, session expired).
*   **FR2.4 (P0): Favicon Display:** The extension MUST attempt to retrieve the favicon URL for each unique domain associated with saved sessions and display it in the session list within the popup to aid visual identification. Fallback to a generic icon if favicon fetch fails.

### 4.3. Authentication & Synchronization

*   **FR3.1 (P0): Authentication Method:** User authentication MUST be implemented using Email and Password.
*   **FR3.2 (P0): Sign Up / Sign In Interface:** The extension popup MUST provide forms for user Sign Up (Email, Password, Password Confirmation) and Sign In (Email, Password).
*   **FR3.3 (P0): Backend Endpoint:** Authentication requests (Sign Up, Sign In) MUST be sent securely (HTTPS) to the backend API.
*   **FR3.4 (P0): Authentication State:** The extension MUST securely store the user's authentication state (e.g., using a JWT token received from the backend) in `chrome.storage.local` or similar secure storage. The UI MUST reflect the logged-in/logged-out state.
*   **FR3.5 (P0): Logout:** A logout button MUST be available for authenticated users, clearing the local authentication state and refreshing the UI.
*   **FR3.6 (P0): Backend Storage:** The backend MUST use MongoDB to store user accounts (email, hashed password) and their associated saved sessions.
*   **FR3.7 (P0): Data Synchronization:**
    *   Synchronization MUST occur when an authenticated user performs a Save action (FR1.8) or potentially an auto-save during Restore conflict (FR1.6).
    *   The extension MUST send the newly saved/updated session data (name, domain, timestamp, cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) to the backend API via HTTPS.
    *   The backend API MUST associate the received session data with the authenticated user making the request.
    *   **Initial Sync:** Upon successful login, the extension SHOULD fetch all sessions stored in the backend for the user and merge them with the local session store. A simple merge strategy (e.g., backend data overwrites local if timestamps conflict, otherwise add) should be used, prioritizing newer data if timestamps are available and reliable.
*   **FR3.8 (P0): Offline Functionality:**
    *   All core actions (Save, List, Restore sessions) MUST function using local storage when the user is offline or the backend is unreachable.
    *   For authenticated users, when saving a session offline, the extension MUST mark it as "pending sync".
    *   When network connectivity is restored, the extension MUST attempt to sync any pending changes to the backend automatically (e.g., using `chrome.alarms` API for periodic checks or listening to online/offline events).
*   **FR3.9 (P0): Unauthenticated Users:**
    *   Users who have not signed up or are not signed in MUST be able to use the full local save/restore functionality (FR1.1 - FR1.7, FR1.9 - FR1.11).
    *   Their data MUST be stored only locally.
    *   The UI MUST clearly indicate that sessions are stored locally only and offer the option to Sign Up/Sign In to enable syncing.
    *   If an unauthenticated user later signs up/logs in, the extension SHOULD prompt them: "Do you want to sync your locally saved sessions to your account?". If yes, trigger a sync of all local sessions to the backend.

### 4.4. Security & Permissions

*   **FR4.1 (P0): Browser Permissions:** The extension manifest (`manifest.json`) MUST declare and request the following permissions, with justification:
    *   `storage`: To store extension settings, user auth state, and session data locally.
    *   `cookies`: To read and write cookies for the target websites.
    *   `scripting`: To execute scripts in the context of webpages for accessing and manipulating `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
    *   `activeTab`: To get the URL/domain of the current tab when the user invokes the extension via popup or context menu (minimizes broad host permissions initially).
    *   `contextMenus`: To add the "Save Session" option to the right-click menu.
    *   `alarms`: (Optional but recommended for reliable offline sync checks) To schedule periodic checks for syncing pending data.
    *   `host_permissions`: `<all_urls>` is required to allow setting cookies/storage and executing scripts on *any* website the user wants to save a session for. This requires clear justification to the user during installation/update. Alternatively, prompt for host permissions dynamically using `permissions.request()` when the user first tries to save a session for a new domain, but `<all_urls>` provides a smoother experience given the extension's purpose. **Requirement:** Use `<all_urls>`.
*   **FR4.2 (P0): Data Security in Transit:** All communication between the browser extension and the backend API MUST use HTTPS.
*   **FR4.3 (P0): Backend Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   The backend API MUST validate the authentication token (e.g., JWT) sent with each request requiring authentication (saving, fetching sessions).
    *   API endpoints MUST ensure that a user can only access or modify their *own* session data. Requests attempting to access data belonging to other users MUST be rejected with an appropriate error code (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
*   **FR4.4 (P0): Password Security:** User passwords MUST NEVER be stored in plaintext. The backend MUST store cryptographically hashed passwords using a strong, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
*   **FR4.5 (P1): Rate Limiting:** The backend API MUST implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (Sign Up, Sign In) and potentially sensitive API calls to mitigate brute-force attacks and abuse.
*   **FR4.6 (P0): Session Data Security at Rest:**
    *   **User Specification:** Per user requirements, session data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) stored in the MongoDB database will **NOT** be encrypted at rest.
    *   **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** This approach carries significant risk. Storing potentially sensitive session cookies and tokens in plaintext on the backend means that a compromise of the database server could expose active login sessions for multiple users across various websites. **It is strongly recommended to implement encryption at rest for this sensitive data.** The AI agent must proceed with this requirement as specified but understand the associated risks. The implementation should make it feasible to add encryption later if this decision is revisited.
*   **FR4.7 (P0): Secure Token Storage:** Authentication tokens stored within the extension MUST be protected using appropriate browser storage mechanisms (`chrome.storage.local` is generally acceptable, but avoid storing in `localStorage` accessible by web pages).

### 4.5. Technical Requirements & Architecture

*   **FR5.1 (P0): Browser Extension:**
    *   Platform: Browser Extension for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) and Firefox.
    *   Manifest Version: Manifest V3 MUST be used.
    *   Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+). No specific framework mandated, but vanilla JS or a lightweight helper library is acceptable.
    *   Structure: The `extension/` folder MUST contain all extension code, organized logically (e.g., `popup/`, `background/` (service worker), `content_scripts/`, `common/`, `assets/`).
*   **FR5.2 (P0): Backend:**
    *   Platform: Node.js with Express.js framework.
    *   Database: MongoDB.
    *   API: RESTful JSON API served over HTTPS.
    *   Structure: The `backend/` folder MUST contain all backend code, organized logically (e.g., `routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).
*   **FR5.3 (P0): Modularity & Maintainability:** Both frontend (extension) and backend code MUST be written in a modular fashion, using functions, classes, and potentially modules (ES Modules) where appropriate. Code MUST be well-commented, follow consistent coding style guidelines (e.g., ESLint/Prettier configured), and be easy to understand and maintain.
*   **FR5.4 (P0): Error Handling:** Both extension and backend MUST implement robust error handling. Backend errors should return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in JSON format. Extension should catch errors gracefully and provide user-friendly feedback (FR2.3). Logging (console logging during development, potentially more structured logging in production backend) should be implemented for debugging.

### 4.6. Edge Cases & Miscellaneous

*   **FR6.1 (P0): No Limits:** There MUST be no artificial limit imposed by the extension or backend on the number of websites or sessions a user can save. Performance should degrade gracefully with a very large number of sessions.
*   **FR6.2 (P1): Handling Website Changes:** The extension cannot guarantee that a restored session will work if the target website has significantly changed its login mechanism, cookie structure, or session handling since the session was saved. If a restore appears successful but the user is not logged in, the extension is not fundamentally at fault. However, clear error messages should be shown if the *process* of setting cookies/storage fails (e.g., due to new Content Security Policies on the site).
*   **FR6.3 (P0): Empty Sessions:** The extension SHOULD allow saving a session even if `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` is empty for the domain.
*   **FR6.4 (P1): Large Storage Data:** The extension MUST handle potentially large data strings stored in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. Consider browser storage limits (`chrome.storage.local` quotas) and potential performance implications. Using IndexedDB might be more suitable than `chrome.storage.local` if extremely large session data is anticipated per session. Agent to evaluate based on typical storage sizes.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1 (Performance):**
    *   The extension MUST NOT noticeably degrade browser performance during normal browsing.
    *   Session save and restore operations SHOULD feel responsive (ideally complete within 1-2 seconds, excluding network latency for sync).
    *   Backend API response times SHOULD be under 500ms for typical requests under normal load.
*   **NFR2 (Reliability):**
    *   Session saving and restoring MUST be highly reliable. Data corruption should be prevented.
    *   Synchronization MUST be robust, handling network interruptions and retrying failed sync attempts where appropriate.
*   **NFR3 (Usability):**
    *   The UI MUST be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users.
    *   Feedback MUST be clear and timely.
*   **NFR4 (Security):** Adherence to all requirements in Section 4.4 is paramount. Robust protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS in popup, CSRF if applicable, insecure backend dependencies) MUST be implemented.
*   **NFR5 (Maintainability):** Code MUST be well-structured, commented, and adhere to defined coding standards to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.
*   **NFR6 (Compatibility):** The extension MUST function correctly on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.

## 6. Release Criteria

*   All P0 functional requirements are implemented and verified through testing.
*   All P1 functional requirements are implemented and verified through testing.
*   Core user stories (US1-US10) are demonstrable and function correctly.
*   Security requirements (especially authentication, authorization, password hashing, HTTPS) are implemented and verified. The risk of unencrypted data at rest is documented and understood.
*   No critical or blocking bugs exist in the core functionality.
*   The extension passes review processes for the relevant browser web stores (if intended for public distribution).
*   Basic performance benchmarks are met (NFR1).

## 7. Open Questions / Assumptions

*   **Assumption:** Users understand the security implications of storing session data, especially if sync is enabled (compounded by the decision not to encrypt at rest).
*   **Assumption:** Favicon fetching will rely on publicly accessible favicon URLs or a standard mechanism (e.g., Google's favicon service `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=example.com`, ensuring privacy implications are considered).
*   **Assumption:** The definition of "session expiration" notification (FR1.10) can rely primarily on the `expirationDate` property of cookies. Detecting functional session invalidity without making requests is generally not feasible.

---

**Instruction to AI Agent:** Please ensure you adhere strictly to these requirements, particularly the specified technology stack, functional behaviors, security measures (including the explicit requirement *not* to encrypt at rest, while being aware of the risk), and the requested project structure. Deliver well-documented, modular, and production-ready code for both the browser extension (Manifest V3) and the backend service. Fulfill all P0 and P1 requirements. Pay close attention to error handling and user feedback mechanisms. Address the HttpOnly cookie limitations as specified in FR1.9.
