**Product Name:** Session Sync Pro

**Product Goal:** To create a robust and user-friendly browser extension that allows users to save, manage, and restore website sessions (including cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`) for specific domains. The extension features user accounts for syncing saved sessions securely across multiple devices and browsers.

**Target Audience:** Users who frequently switch between multiple accounts or states on the same website (e.g., developers, testers, social media managers, individuals managing personal and work profiles).

**Vision:** Simplify multi-account management and session persistence across devices, enhancing productivity and user experience by providing a seamless, one-click session restoration mechanism.

---

## 2. Goals

*   **Simplify Session Management:** Allow users to easily save and restore complete web sessions for specific sites with minimal effort.
*   **Enable Cross-Device Access:** Provide a mechanism for users to access their saved sessions from any device where the extension is installed and they are logged in.
*   **Ensure Data Persistence:** Reliably store session data both locally for offline access and remotely for synchronization.
*   **Provide Security:** Implement necessary security measures for user authentication and data handling, acknowledging specified constraints.
*   **Deliver User-Friendly Experience:** Offer an intuitive interface within the browser for managing sessions.
*   **Build a Production-Ready Solution:** Deliver a complete, well-tested, and maintainable extension, not just a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

---

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Web Developers & QA Testers:** Need to switch between different user roles, test accounts, or application states quickly.
*   **Social Media Managers:** Manage multiple client or personal accounts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
*   **Freelancers & Consultants:** Juggle various client logins across different web applications.
*   **General Users:** Individuals who maintain separate personal, work, or hobby accounts on the same websites (e.g., different Google accounts, shopping site accounts).

---

## 4. Core Features and Functional Requirements

This section details the specific functionalities the extension must provide. Priority is marked (P0 = Must-have for launch).

### 4.1 Technical Foundation (P0)

*   **FR1.1 (P0): Architecture & Stack:**
    *   **Type:** Browser Extension (Google Chrome, potentially Firefox/Edge with cross-browser considerations).
    *   **Manifest:** Manifest V3.
    *   **Frontend (Extension):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or a lightweight framework like Preact/Vue if deemed necessary for complexity, but focus on minimal overhead).
    *   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework.
    *   **Database:** MongoDB.
    *   **Project Structure:** Maintain a clear separation between frontend and backend code:
        ```
        session-sync-pro/
        ├── extension/       # All browser extension code (manifest, popup, content scripts, background scripts)
        │   ├── manifest.json
        │   ├── icons/
        │   ├── popup/
        │   │   ├── popup.html
        │   │   ├── popup.css
        │   │   └── popup.js

        │   │   └── service-worker.js
        │   ├── content-scripts/
        │   │   └── content.js  (if needed for DOM interaction/context menu)
        │   └── common/         # Shared utilities, API clients etc.
        ├── backend/         # All backend server code
        │   ├── src/
        │   │   ├── controllers/
        │   │   ├── models/
        │   │   ├── routes/
        │   │   ├── services/
        │   │   ├── middleware/
        │   │   └── config/
        │   ├── package.json
        │   └── server.js
        └── README.md
        ```
    *   **Code Quality:** Code must be well-documented (comments explaining complex logic), follow consistent coding standards (e.g., ESLint/Prettier), be modular, and easily maintainable.

### 4.2 Session Saving (P0)

*   **FR2.1 (P0): Manual Trigger:** Users must be able to initiate session saving manually.
    *   **Mechanism:** A "Save Current Session" button prominently displayed within the extension's popup interface when viewed on a webpage.
    *   **Context Menu:** A "Save Session for this site" option available via the right-click context menu on a webpage.
*   **FR2.2 (P0): Data Scope:** Saving a session must capture the following data for the *current, specific domain* (e.g., `app.example.com`, not `*.example.com` unless explicitly configured otherwise later - stick to exact domain for now):
    *   All non-HttpOnly Cookies associated with the domain.
    *   All `localStorage` key-value pairs for the origin.
    *   All `sessionStorage` key-value pairs for the origin.
*   **FR2.3 (P0): Session Naming:** Upon clicking "Save", the user must be prompted to provide a custom, meaningful name for the saved session (e.g., "Work Admin Account", "Test User Alice").
    *   Validation: Name should not be empty. Consider restrictions on length or special characters if necessary.
*   **FR2.4 (P0): HttpOnly Cookie Handling:**
    *   The extension cannot directly read `HttpOnly` cookies due to browser security restrictions.
    *   **Action:** The extension should attempt to save all *readable* cookies (non-HttpOnly).
    *   **User Notification:** When saving a session, if the extension detects the potential presence of `HttpOnly` cookies (e.g., based on common naming patterns or if saving seems incomplete), it should inform the user with a message like: "Session saved. Note: Some secure login details (HttpOnly cookies) cannot be fully captured by the extension and might need manual re-entry upon restore if the session appears invalid." This manages user expectations.
*   **FR2.5 (P0): Storage Location:** Saved sessions must be stored locally within the browser's extension storage (`chrome.storage.local`). If the user is logged in, the saved session data must also be sent to the backend for synchronization immediately after local save confirmation.
*   **FR2.6 (P0): Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback to the user upon successful save (e.g., "Session '[Session Name]' saved successfully!") or if an error occurs (e.g., "Failed to save session. Please try again.").

### 4.3 Session Restoring (P0)

*   **FR3.1 (P0): Trigger:** Users restore sessions by selecting a previously saved session from the list within the extension popup and clicking a "Restore" button associated with that session.
*   **FR3.2 (P0): Context:** Restoration should ideally be triggered when the user is actively viewing a tab open to the website domain corresponding to the saved session. The extension should verify the current tab's URL domain matches the session's domain before proceeding.
*   **FR3.3 (P0): Conflict Handling:** If the user clicks "Restore" while potentially having an active session (detected by presence of cookies/localStorage/sessionStorage for the domain):
    *   **Prompt:** Display a confirmation dialog: "Restoring '[Saved Session Name]' will replace your current session data for '[domain]'. Do you want to save the current session first before restoring?"
    *   **Options:** "Save & Restore", "Restore Anyway", "Cancel".
    *   **If "Save & Restore":** Trigger the save process for the *current* session (prompting for a name or using an auto-generated one like "Autosaved - [Timestamp]"). After successful save, proceed with restoration.
    *   **If "Restore Anyway":** Proceed directly to the restoration process, overwriting current data.
    *   **If "Cancel":** Abort the restoration process.
*   **FR3.4 (P0): Restoration Mechanism:** Restoring a session involves:
    *   Clearing all existing cookies (including potentially `HttpOnly` ones, which extensions *can* typically delete) for the specific domain.
    *   Clearing all existing `localStorage` for the origin.
    *   Clearing all existing `sessionStorage` for the origin.
    *   Setting the cookies saved in the selected session data (respecting attributes like domain, path, secure, etc.).
    *   Populating `localStorage` with the key-value pairs from the saved session data.
    *   Populating `sessionStorage` with the key-value pairs from the saved session data.
*   **FR3.5 (P0): Page Reload:** After successfully restoring session data, the extension must prompt the user to reload the page for the changes to take effect.
    *   **Prompt:** "Session restored successfully! Reload the page now to apply changes?"
    *   **Options:** "Reload", "Later". Provide a clear visual indicator if reload is pending.
*   **FR3.6 (P0): Feedback:** Provide clear feedback: "Session '[Session Name]' restored successfully. Please reload the page." or "Failed to restore session. The saved data might be invalid or expired."
*   **FR3.7 (P0): Session Expiration Handling:** The extension itself doesn't track server-side expiration. However, if a user restores a session and finds they are still logged out after reloading, the extension should provide guidance.
    *   **Notification (Passive):** Display a persistent note in the UI or help section: "Restored sessions might be expired if they were saved long ago. If restoration doesn't log you in, you may need to log in manually."
    *   **Error Message Context:** If restoration fails technically, the error message can suggest expiration as a possible cause.

### 4.4 Session Management Interface (P0)

*   **FR4.1 (P0): Access Points:**
    *   **Browser Action Popup:** The primary interface, accessible via the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
    *   **Context Menu:** Right-click menu on web pages offering relevant actions (e.g., "Save Session for this site").
*   **FR4.2 (P0): Session List Display:**
    *   **Organization:** Saved sessions must be listed within the popup, grouped by the website domain they belong to.
    *   **Identification:** Each list item must clearly display:
        *   The user-defined session name.
        *   The website domain/URL.
        *   The website's favicon (fetch dynamically or store a reference).
    *   **Ordering:** Sessions within each website group could be ordered alphabetically by name or by save date (newest first). Provide user setting? Default to newest first.
*   **FR4.3 (P0): Session Actions:** For each saved session in the list, provide clear action buttons/icons for:
    *   **Restore:** Initiates the restoration process (FR3.1).
    *   **Rename:** Allows the user to change the custom name of the saved session.
    *   **Delete:** Permanently removes the saved session (with confirmation prompt: "Are you sure you want to delete session '[Session Name]'?"). Deletion must occur locally and trigger a sync delete to the backend if the user is logged in.
*   **FR4.4 (P0): Search/Filter:** Implement a search bar within the popup to filter the list of saved sessions by session name or website domain. This is crucial for users with many saved sessions.
*   **FR4.5 (P0): Visibility Without Login:** Users must be able to see and manage their *locally* saved sessions even when not logged into a Session Sync Pro account. Sync-related features will be disabled/hidden.

### 4.5 User Authentication (P0)

*   **FR5.1 (P0): Authentication Method:** Support **Email/Password** based authentication only.
*   **FR5.2 (P0): Account Actions:** Provide options within the extension popup for:
    *   **Sign Up:** Collect Email and Password (with confirmation). Perform basic validation (email format, password strength).
    *   **Sign In:** Allow existing users to log in using Email and Password.
    *   **Sign Out:** Allow logged-in users to sign out.
*   **FR5.3 (P0): Authentication State:** The extension UI must clearly indicate whether the user is currently logged in or not (e.g., display user email, show Sign Out button vs. Sign In/Up buttons).
*   **FR5.4 (P0): Password Security:** Passwords must **never** be stored in plaintext. Use a strong hashing algorithm with salt (e.g., bcrypt) on the backend (Q21).
*   **FR5.5 (P0): Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login and sign-up endpoints on the backend to mitigate brute-force attacks (Q21).

### 4.6 Data Synchronization (P0)

*   **FR6.1 (P0): Sync Trigger:** Synchronization between the local extension storage and the backend database must occur automatically whenever:
    *   A user successfully logs in (fetch all remote sessions).
    *   A new session is saved locally (push to backend).
    *   An existing session is updated (renamed) locally (push update to backend).
    *   A session is deleted locally (push delete instruction to backend).
    *   A session is restored (no data change, but good practice to ensure sync state is current). *Correction: Restoration itself doesn't change saved data, but the optional "Save Current Session" before restore does.*
*   **FR6.2 (P0): Backend Storage:** Use MongoDB as the backend database (Q14). Design a schema to store user account information and their associated saved sessions (including domain, name, cookies, localStorage data, sessionStorage data).
*   **FR6.3 (P0): Data Security in Transit:** All communication between the browser extension and the backend server **must** use HTTPS (Q16).
*   **FR6.4 (P0): Data Security at Rest:**
    *   **User Requirement:** Per Q15, session data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) will **not** be encrypted at rest in the MongoDB database.
    *   **SECURITY WARNING:** **This is a significant security risk.** Storing sensitive session cookies and potentially other PII from localStorage/sessionStorage in plaintext on the backend makes the database an extremely high-value target. If compromised, attackers could potentially hijack user sessions on various websites. **It is strongly recommended to reconsider this requirement and implement encryption at rest (e.g., field-level encryption within MongoDB or application-level encryption before saving).** The implementation must proceed as specified, but this risk must be acknowledged. User account passwords *must* still be hashed.
*   **FR6.5 (P0): Offline Handling:**
    *   The extension must function fully for saving and restoring sessions using *local* storage when the user is offline or not logged in (Q18, Q19).
    *   When the user comes online and logs in, the extension must attempt to sync local changes (saves, deletes, updates made while offline) with the backend.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Define a basic strategy. Suggestion: "Last Write Wins" based on timestamp (either client-side timestamp or server-side timestamp upon sync). If a session exists both locally and remotely with different data but similar timestamps (within a small window), the version being actively pushed (e.g., the local save being synced) overwrites the other. More complex resolution (e.g., prompting the user) is out of scope for v1.0 unless explicitly requested.
*   **FR6.6 (P0): Backend Authorization:** The backend API must implement robust authorization checks. Ensure that API requests to read, create, update, or delete session data are strictly limited to the authenticated user who owns that data (Q20). Use JWT tokens or session-based authentication managed by the backend.

### 4.7 Configuration & Settings (P0)

*   **FR7.1 (P0): Whitelist/Blacklist:** Provide a settings section within the extension popup where users can manage a list of domains for which the extension should be disabled (blacklist) or enabled (if defaulting to disabled - choose one approach, blacklist is often simpler). This prevents the extension's content scripts or context menus from appearing on sensitive sites if desired.
*   **FR7.2 (P0): Account Management:** Within a settings or account section (visible when logged in):
    *   Allow users to change their password.
    *   Provide an option to **Delete Account**, which must remove all user data (account info and saved sessions) from the backend database after confirmation.

### 4.8 Error Handling & Notifications (P0)

*   **FR8.1 (P0): Clear Feedback:** Provide clear, user-friendly messages for success and failure scenarios related to saving, restoring, syncing, login, signup, etc. (Q11). Avoid technical jargon where possible.
*   **FR8.2 (P0): Specific Error Handling:**
    *   **Sync Failures:** Inform the user if syncing with the backend fails, indicating they might be offline or there's a server issue. Data should remain locally.
    *   **Login/Signup Failures:** Provide specific reasons (e.g., "Invalid email or password", "Email already exists").
    *   **Restore Issues:** Acknowledge potential reasons like expired sessions or website changes (Q21, Q24).
    *   **Permission Errors:** If the extension lacks necessary permissions, guide the user on how to grant them.
    *   **HttpOnly Limitation Notice:** Ensure the notification about potential HttpOnly limitations during save is clear (FR2.4).

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1 (P0): Security:**
    *   **Authentication:** Secure user login (hashed passwords, HTTPS, rate limiting).
    *   **Authorization:** Strict data access control on the backend.
    *   **Data Storage:** Implement as specified (plaintext session data at rest - **WITH STRONG WARNINGS**) but ensure password hashing is robust.
    *   **Permissions:** Request only necessary browser permissions (`cookies`, `storage`, `activeTab`, `<all_urls>`, potentially `contextMenus`, `alarms` for periodic sync checks if needed) and justify them clearly in the extension description/store listing (Q19). Use `<all_urls>` carefully, as it requires user trust.
*   **NFR2 (P0): Performance:**
    *   **Responsiveness:** Extension popup UI should load quickly and be responsive.
    *   **Browser Impact:** Minimize CPU and memory usage; avoid impacting browser performance or page load times significantly. Content scripts should be efficient.
    *   **Sync Efficiency:** Backend communication should be optimized to transfer only necessary data.
*   **NFR3 (P0): Reliability:**
    *   **Data Integrity:** Session data must be saved and restored accurately. Syncing should not lead to data corruption.
    *   **Availability:** The backend service should aim for high availability (specific uptime % TBD based on infrastructure).
    *   **Offline Robustness:** Core save/restore functionality must work reliably offline.
*   **NFR4 (P0): Usability:**
    *   **Intuitive UI:** Easy to understand and navigate the popup and options.
    *   **Clear Feedback:** Users should always know the status of their actions.
    *   **Minimal Friction:** Saving and restoring sessions should require minimal clicks.
*   **NFR5 (P0): Maintainability:**
    *   **Modular Code:** Follow the specified project structure (FR1.1). Use functions/classes effectively.
    *   **Documentation:** Add comments for complex logic and JSDoc/TSDoc blocks where appropriate. Create a `README.md` explaining setup and architecture.
    *   **Consistency:** Adhere to chosen coding standards and patterns.
*   **NFR6 (P0): Scalability:**
    *   While no hard limits are set on sessions (Q22), the backend design should consider potential growth. Database queries should be indexed appropriately (e.g., index user ID, domain). Choose backend infrastructure that can scale if needed (e.g., managed MongoDB service, scalable server instances).
*   **NFR7 (P0): Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Initially target Google Chrome. Design with potential future porting to Firefox/Edge in mind (avoid Chrome-specific APIs where standard WebExtension APIs exist).

---

## 6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Design

*   **Popup UI:**
    *   **Header:** Extension name/logo. Login/Signup buttons OR User email + Logout button + Settings icon.
    *   **Save Section (Contextual):** If on a valid webpage, show "Save Current Session for [domain]" button.
    *   **Search Bar:** Prominently placed for filtering sessions.
    *   **Session List:** Grouped by domain. Each domain is a collapsible section header. Underneath, list saved sessions with Name, Favicon, Restore/Rename/Delete actions.
    *   **Settings View (Accessed via icon):** Account management (Change Pwd, Delete Account), Whitelist/Blacklist management.
*   **Context Menu:** Add an item "Session Sync Pro" with a sub-item "Save Session for this site".
*   **Visual Design:** Clean, simple, and professional. Align with standard browser UI patterns. Use clear visual cues for states (loading, success, error).
*   **Favicons:** Fetch and display website favicons next to domain names/session entries for easier identification. Handle cases where favicons aren't available gracefully (use a default icon).

---

## 7. User Stories

*   **US1 (Save Session):** As a user managing multiple accounts, I want to click a button in the extension popup or use the context menu while on a website, so that I can save my current session (cookies, local/session storage) with a custom name for later use.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Save button/menu item is available on valid web pages.
        *   Clicking save prompts for a session name.
        *   After confirming the name, the session data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) is saved locally.
        *   A success message is shown.
        *   If logged in, the data is synced to the backend.
        *   A warning is shown if potential HttpOnly cookies couldn't be fully captured.
*   **US2 (Restore Session):** As a user wanting to switch accounts, I want to open the extension popup, find my previously saved session for the current website in a list, and click "Restore", so that my browser state is switched to the saved session, prompting me to reload the page.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Saved sessions are listed, grouped by website, showing name and favicon.
        *   Clicking "Restore" on a session matching the current domain prompts for confirmation if data exists.
        *   Optionally saves current session if requested by user during confirmation.
        *   Existing session data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) for the domain is cleared.
        *   Saved session data is applied.
        *   Success message is shown, prompting user to reload.
*   **US3 (Sync Across Devices):** As a user with multiple computers, I want to log into my Session Sync Pro account on each computer, so that sessions I save on one device are automatically available for restoration on another device.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can Sign Up and Sign In using Email/Password.
        *   Saving/Deleting/Renaming a session while logged in triggers a sync to the backend.
        *   Logging in on a new device fetches all sessions from the backend.
        *   Changes made on one logged-in device reflect on other logged-in devices after a sync event or periodic check.
*   **US4 (Offline Access):** As a user who might be temporarily offline, I want to still be able to save and restore my sessions locally, so that my workflow is not interrupted.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Saving and restoring sessions works using local browser storage when offline or not logged in.
        *   Locally saved changes are queued for sync when connectivity is restored and the user logs in.
*   **US5 (Manage Sessions):** As a user with many saved sessions, I want to be able to easily find, rename, and delete sessions I no longer need, so that my session list remains organized.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Search bar filters the session list effectively by name or domain.
        *   Rename option allows changing the session name, persists locally and syncs.
        *   Delete option removes the session after confirmation, persists locally and syncs.

## 8. Data Management & Security Summary

*   **Local Storage:** `chrome.storage.local` for offline persistence and as the primary working copy.
*   **Backend Database:** MongoDB.
*   **Data Sync:** Real-time sync on CUD operations when online and logged in. Offline changes sync on login/reconnect.
*   **Session Data Storage:** Cookies (non-HttpOnly readable attributes + values), localStorage (key-value pairs), sessionStorage (key-value pairs) stored per user, associated with a domain and session name. **Stored unencrypted at rest per user requirement - HIGH RISK.**
*   **User Data Storage:** User email, hashed password (bcrypt).
*   **Transit Security:** HTTPS mandatory for all backend communication.
*   **Access Control:** Backend APIs must enforce strict user ownership of data.

---

## 9. Error Handling & Edge Cases Summary

*   Provide user-friendly error messages for all potential failures (save, restore, sync, auth, API errors).
*   Handle offline state gracefully, relying on local storage.
*   Manage sync conflicts (default: last write wins).
*   Inform users about HttpOnly limitations.
*   Guide users if restored sessions appear expired or invalid due to website changes.
*   Handle browser permission issues by guiding the user.
*   Ensure UI handles empty states (no sessions saved, no search results).

---

## 10. Release Criteria

*   All P0 features (Sections 4.1 - 4.8) are implemented according to functional requirements.
*   All non-functional requirements (Section 5) are met, particularly security measures (password hashing, HTTPS, rate limiting, authorization) and performance benchmarks (TBD).
*   Major user stories (Section 7) are demonstrable and meet acceptance criteria.
*   Comprehensive testing completed: unit tests, integration tests (extension <-> backend), end-to-end tests simulating user flows, security testing (penetration testing highly recommended given the sensitive data).
*   Code is well-documented, follows specified structure and quality standards.
*   Extension successfully installable and functional on the target browser (Google Chrome).
*   User documentation (basic usage guide, FAQ addressing limitations like HttpOnly) is prepared.
*   **Explicit sign-off acknowledging the security risk of storing session data unencrypted at rest.**
