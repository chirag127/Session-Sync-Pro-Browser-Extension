# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Session Sync Pro Browser Extension

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** [Your Name/AI Prompt]
**Target Audience:** AI Development Agent

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Session Sync Pro

**Product Goal:** To create a browser extension that allows users to securely save, manage, and restore complete web sessions (including cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`) for specific websites. The extension will feature user accounts (Sign Up/Sign In via Email/Password) to enable seamless synchronization of saved sessions across multiple devices using a dedicated backend service (Express.js + MongoDB).

**Vision:** Session Sync Pro aims to significantly improve productivity for users who frequently switch between different accounts or states on the same website (e.g., developers, testers, users with multiple profiles) by providing a one-click session restore mechanism and cross-device synchronization.

## 2. Goals

*   **G1:** Provide a reliable mechanism to save the complete session state (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) for a specific website domain.
*   **G2:** Enable users to restore saved sessions easily, replacing the current session state for that domain.
*   **G3:** Implement a user authentication system (Email/Password) for account creation and login.
*   **G4:** Synchronize saved sessions across devices for authenticated users via a secure backend infrastructure.
*   **G5:** Offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface within the browser (popup and context menu).
*   **G6:** Ensure user data privacy and security during transit and storage (within the defined constraints).
*   **G7:** Build a robust and maintainable solution using modern web technologies (Manifest V3, Express.js, MongoDB).

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Web Developers:** Testing applications with different user roles or data states.
*   **QA Engineers / Testers:** Managing multiple test accounts and scenarios for web applications.
*   **Users with Multiple Accounts:** Individuals managing personal/work accounts on platforms like social media, project management tools, etc.
*   **Power Users:** Anyone needing to quickly switch contexts or save application states on specific websites.

## 4. Core Features and Functional Requirements

This section details the specific functionalities the AI agent must implement. All functional requirements listed are considered **Priority: P0 (Essential for Release)** unless otherwise noted.

### 4.1 Session Saving

*   **FR1.1 (P0): Save Session Data**
    *   **Description:** The extension must be able to capture and save session-related data for the *currently active tab's specific website domain* (e.g., `app.example.com`, not `*.example.com`).
    *   **Data Scope:** Includes:
        *   All non-HttpOnly cookies associated with the exact domain.
        *   The entire contents of `localStorage` for the origin.
        *   The entire contents of `sessionStorage` for the origin.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, when I am on `my-app.com/dashboard`, I want to save my current login session and application state so I can restore it later.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Saving captures cookies relevant only to the exact hostname shown in the URL bar.
        *   Saving captures the complete `localStorage` key-value pairs for that origin.
        *   Saving captures the complete `sessionStorage` key-value pairs for that origin.
        *   The saved data is stored correctly either locally or prepared for backend sync.

*   **FR1.2 (P0): Manual Save Trigger**
    *   **Description:** Session saving must be initiated manually by the user.
    *   **Trigger:** A dedicated "Save Current Session" button within the extension's browser action popup when the user is on a target website. An option to save via the page's context menu should also be available.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to explicitly decide when to save a session by clicking a button in the extension popup or right-clicking on the page.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A "Save Current Session" button/option is visible and functional in the popup UI when viewing a webpage.
        *   A "Save Session for this Site" option is available in the right-click context menu on webpages.
        *   Clicking the save button/option triggers the session saving process (FR1.1).

*   **FR1.3 (P0): Custom Session Naming**
    *   **Description:** When saving a session, the user must be prompted to provide a custom, meaningful name for it.
    *   **Implementation:** After clicking "Save Session", prompt the user (e.g., via a modal in the popup or a dedicated input field) to enter a name (e.g., "Admin Account", "Test User Dave"). A default name (e.g., based on timestamp or domain) can be suggested but must be editable.
    *   **User Story:** As a user saving multiple sessions for `jira.example.com`, I want to name them "Bug Triager Role" and "Developer Role" so I can easily distinguish them later.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User is prompted for a session name upon initiating a save.
        *   The provided name is stored alongside the session data.
        *   Input validation ensures a name is provided (cannot be empty).

*   **FR1.4 (P0): Handling HttpOnly Cookies**
    *   **Description:** The extension must handle the limitation that it cannot directly *read* `HttpOnly` cookies due to browser security restrictions (Manifest V3). It *can* attempt to set/delete them during restore.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   The extension will attempt to save all *accessible* cookies (non-HttpOnly).
        *   During the save process, if the extension detects it's on a site likely using `HttpOnly` cookies for critical session management (e.g., common session cookie names, or simply as a general warning), it should inform the user *after* the save attempt.
        *   The notification should clearly state that while other data (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, non-HttpOnly cookies) was saved, the core login state (potentially tied to `HttpOnly` cookies) might not be fully captured, and restoration might require re-login.
    *   **User Story:** As a user saving a session on my bank's website, I want to be informed if the extension couldn't fully capture the critical login cookie due to security restrictions, so I understand why a restore might not fully log me back in.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The extension saves all readable cookies.
        *   A non-blocking notification/message appears in the extension UI after saving on potentially problematic sites, explaining the `HttpOnly` limitation and its implication for restoration.
        *   The save operation still completes for accessible data.

*   **FR1.5 (P0): No Session Limits**
    *   **Description:** There should be no built-in limit to the number of sessions or the number of distinct websites for which sessions can be saved by a user. Limits may only be imposed by local storage capacity or backend database constraints (which should be designed to be large).
    *   **User Story:** As a power user, I want to save sessions for dozens of different websites and multiple accounts on each without hitting an arbitrary limit.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The extension logic does not enforce a maximum number of saved sessions per user or per website.
        *   Performance remains acceptable even with a large number of saved sessions.

*   **FR1.6 (P0): Handling Various Session Techniques**
    *   **Description:** The extension must correctly save and restore data from `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, which are often used for storing session tokens (like JWTs) or application state.
    *   **Implementation:** Ensure the mechanisms for reading from and writing to `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` via content scripts or the `scripting` API are robust and handle various data types stored within (strings, JSON objects stringified, etc.).
    *   **User Story:** As a user of a modern web app that uses JWTs stored in `localStorage`, I want Session Sync Pro to save and restore this token correctly so I am logged in after restoring the session.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Saving correctly captures the full state of `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for the origin.
        *   Restoring correctly clears and replaces the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` with the saved state.
        *   Handles potential JSON parsing errors gracefully if data is not stored as valid JSON.

### 4.2 Session Restoration

*   **FR2.1 (P0): Restore Trigger & Interface**
    *   **Description:** Users must be able to view their saved sessions and initiate a restore action from the extension popup.
    *   **Interface:** The popup will display a list of saved sessions. Each item in the list should have a clear "Restore" button.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to open the extension popup, see my saved sessions, and click a "Restore" button next to the one I need.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The extension popup lists all saved sessions (local and synced if logged in).
        *   Each session list item is clearly identifiable (name, website) and has a functional "Restore" button.
        *   Clicking "Restore" initiates the restoration process for that specific session.

*   **FR2.2 (P0): Session List Presentation**
    *   **Description:** Saved sessions should be presented in an organized and easily understandable manner within the popup.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Group saved sessions by website domain.
        *   For each saved session, display:
            *   The custom name provided by the user (FR1.3).
            *   The website domain it belongs to.
            *   The website's favicon (best effort retrieval).
    *   **User Story:** As a user with many saved sessions, I want them grouped by website (e.g., all Gmail sessions together, all GitHub sessions together) and clearly labelled with my custom names and the site's icon so I can find the one I want quickly.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Sessions are grouped visually under website headings in the popup list.
        *   Each session entry shows the custom name, domain, and attempts to show the favicon.
        *   The list is scrollable if it exceeds the popup height.

*   **FR2.3 (P0): Conflict Handling on Restore**
    *   **Description:** If the user attempts to restore a session for a website while they are currently active (potentially logged in with a different session) on that same website, the extension must prompt for confirmation before proceeding.
    *   **Implementation:** Before applying the saved session data, check if the current tab's URL matches the domain of the session being restored. If yes, display a confirmation dialog (e.g., "Restoring this session will replace your current session data for [domain]. Are you sure?").
    *   **User Story:** As a user currently logged into my Personal Gmail, if I accidentally click restore on my Work Gmail session, I want the extension to ask me if I'm sure before it logs me out of my personal account.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Confirmation prompt appears if restoring onto an active tab of the same domain.
        *   Restoration only proceeds if the user confirms.
        *   If the user cancels, the current session remains untouched.

*   **FR2.4 (P0): Session Data Replacement**
    *   **Description:** When a session is restored, the extension must *replace* the current session data (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) for that specific domain with the data from the saved session.
    *   **Implementation:** The restoration process must:
        1.  Clear all existing cookies for the specific domain.
        2.  Clear all existing `localStorage` data for the origin.
        3.  Clear all existing `sessionStorage` data for the origin.
        4.  Set the cookies from the saved session.
        5.  Populate `localStorage` with the data from the saved session.
        6.  Populate `sessionStorage` with the data from the saved session.
    *   **User Story:** As a user restoring a saved session, I expect my browser state for that website to exactly match what was saved, effectively logging out the old session and logging in the new one.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Existing cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` for the target domain/origin are completely removed before applying the saved data.
        *   The data from the saved session is correctly applied to the browser's storage mechanisms for that domain/origin.

*   **FR2.5 (P0): Page Reload After Restore**
    *   **Description:** After successfully restoring a session, the user must be prompted whether they want to reload the current page for the changes to take effect.
    *   **Implementation:** Upon successful completion of FR2.4, display a notification or dialog asking the user: "Session restored for [domain]. Reload page to apply changes?" with "Reload" and "Later" (or similar) options.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, after restoring a session, I want the option to reload the page immediately to see the effect, or wait if I need to do something else first.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User is prompted to reload after successful restoration.
        *   Clicking "Reload" reloads the active tab.
        *   Clicking "Later" (or dismissing the prompt) does not reload the page.

*   **FR2.6 (P0): Handling Expired/Invalid Sessions**
    *   **Description:** The extension should attempt to detect and notify the user if a restored session appears to be invalid or expired immediately after restoration.
    *   **Implementation:** While perfect detection is difficult, the extension can monitor for common indicators shortly after a restore (e.g., if a page reload immediately redirects to a login page). If such behavior is suspected, display a notification like: "The restored session for [domain] may be expired or invalid. You might need to log in again." This is best-effort.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, if I restore a session that has since expired on the server, I want the extension to give me a hint that it might not have worked fully, instead of leaving me confused.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The extension includes logic to heuristically detect potential session invalidity post-restore.
        *   A clear, non-intrusive notification is shown if an invalid session state is suspected.

*   **FR2.7 (P0): Handling Website Changes**
    *   **Description:** If a website's structure, cookie usage, or login mechanism changes after a session was saved, a restored session might fail. The extension should handle this gracefully.
    *   **Implementation:** The restoration process itself might complete (data is injected), but the website might not recognize the old session data. If errors occur during the *application* of data (e.g., setting cookies failed), report that. If data is applied but the site doesn't respond as expected (covered partially by FR2.6), the primary response is user education (via documentation or potentially the `HttpOnly` warning). The extension cannot automatically adapt to arbitrary site changes. Focus on robust error reporting during the restore *process*.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, if I try to restore a very old session and the website has changed significantly, I understand it might not work, but I expect the extension to report any errors it encountered during the attempt, rather than failing silently.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Errors encountered during the cookie/storage setting process are caught and reported to the user.
        *   The extension does not crash if restored data is incompatible with the current website state.

### 4.3 User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)

*   **FR3.1 (P0): Interaction Points**
    *   **Description:** Users will interact with the extension primarily through the Browser Action Popup and the page's context menu.
    *   **Popup:** Provides access to:
        *   Sign Up / Sign In buttons (leading to auth flow).
        *   List of saved sessions (view, restore, potentially delete).
        *   "Save Current Session" button.
        *   Status indicators (login status, sync status).
        *   Settings/Options access (e.g., for whitelist/blacklist).
    *   **Context Menu:** Provides a shortcut to "Save Session for this Site".
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want quick access to save and restore functions either by clicking the extension icon or by right-clicking on the webpage.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Extension has a functional browser action icon that opens a popup.
        *   Popup contains the core UI elements described above.
        *   A relevant option appears in the page context menu.

*   **FR3.2 (P0): User Feedback**
    *   **Description:** Provide clear, concise feedback to the user after performing actions.
    *   **Implementation:** Use temporary, non-intrusive notifications (e.g., toasts or status messages within the popup) for:
        *   Successful session save ("Session '[name]' saved for [domain]").
        *   Successful session restore ("Session '[name]' restored for [domain]. Reload?").
        *   Sync status updates ("Syncing...", "Sync complete", "Sync failed").
        *   Error messages (e.g., "Failed to save session: [reason]", "Failed to restore session: [reason]", "Login failed").
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want immediate confirmation when I save or restore a session, and clear messages if something goes wrong.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Success messages are displayed clearly upon completion of save/restore/sync actions.
        *   Error messages are displayed clearly, providing context if possible, when actions fail.
        *   Feedback is timely and disappears automatically or is easily dismissible.

*   **FR3.3 (P0): Whitelist/Blacklist Feature**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to disable the extension's functionality (saving/restoring) on specific websites.
    *   **Implementation:** Provide a settings page accessible from the popup where users can add domains to a "disabled sites" list (blacklist). When the user visits a site on this list, the "Save Session" options should be disabled, and restoration for that site should not be offered.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I don't want Session Sync Pro to interact with my banking website, so I want to add it to a blacklist to prevent accidental saves or restores.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A settings section allows adding/removing domains from a blacklist.
        *   Save/restore functionality is disabled for blacklisted domains.
        *   The UI clearly indicates when the extension is disabled for the current site.

### 4.4 Authentication & Synchronization

*   **FR4.1 (P0): Authentication Method**
    *   **Description:** Implement user Sign Up and Sign In using Email and Password.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Backend needs endpoints for `/auth/signup` and `/auth/login`.
        *   Signup requires email and password, performs validation (email format, password complexity - e.g., min length), checks for existing user, hashes password (FR5.3), stores user in MongoDB.
        *   Login requires email and password, validates credentials against stored hashed password, generates a session token (e.g., JWT) upon success.
        *   Extension securely stores the auth token (e.g., in `chrome.storage.local`) and sends it with subsequent requests to protected backend endpoints.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account using my email and a password, and log in with those credentials to sync my sessions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can successfully create an account via the signup process.
        *   User can successfully log in using their registered email and password.
        *   Auth token is issued on login and stored securely by the extension.
        *   Backend endpoints handle signup/login logic correctly, including validation and password hashing.

*   **FR4.2 (P0): Auth UI Trigger**
    *   **Description:** The extension popup will display "Sign Up" and "Sign In" buttons when the user is logged out.
    *   **Implementation:** These buttons, when clicked, should open a new tab or a dedicated extension page/modal containing the actual Sign Up / Sign In forms. The forms themselves are not embedded directly within the small popup space.
    *   **User Story:** As a logged-out user, I want to see clear buttons in the popup to start the Sign Up or Sign In process.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   "Sign Up" and "Sign In" buttons are visible in the popup only when the user is logged out.
        *   Clicking these buttons initiates the respective authentication flow (e.g., opens the form in a new tab).

*   **FR4.3 (P0): Backend Storage & Sync**
    *   **Description:** Authenticated users' saved sessions (name, domain, cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` data) must be stored in the MongoDB database via the Express.js backend and synced across devices.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Backend needs protected endpoints (requiring auth token) for creating, retrieving, updating (potentially, e.g., rename), and deleting saved sessions.
        *   Data schema in MongoDB should associate sessions with a `userId`.
        *   Define clear API contracts between the extension and backend for session data transfer.
    *   **User Story:** As a logged-in user, when I save a session on my work computer, I want it to automatically appear in the extension on my home computer.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Backend provides CRUD endpoints for user sessions, protected by authentication.
        *   Session data is correctly stored in MongoDB, linked to the authenticated user.
        *   Extension successfully sends saved session data to the backend.
        *   Extension successfully fetches session data from the backend upon login or sync.

*   **FR4.4 (P0): Sync Trigger**
    *   **Description:** Synchronization with the backend should occur automatically after specific user actions when online.
    *   **Implementation:** The extension should initiate a sync operation with the backend:
        *   Immediately after a user successfully saves a new session.
        *   Immediately after a user deletes a session (if delete functionality is added).
        *   Immediately after a user logs in.
        *   Potentially after a user renames a session (if rename functionality is added).
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I expect my changes (like saving a new session) to be pushed to the cloud immediately so they are available on my other devices without manual intervention.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Sync is automatically triggered upon successful save/delete/rename actions when the user is logged in and online.
        *   Sync is triggered upon successful login.

*   **FR4.5 (P0): Offline Functionality**
    *   **Description:** Users must be able to save and restore sessions locally even when offline or logged out.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   The extension must always store saved sessions in the browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) regardless of login or connectivity status.
        *   Restore operations should primarily use this local data.
    *   **User Story:** As a user working offline, I still want to be able to save my current work session locally and restore previously saved local sessions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Saving a session works correctly when the browser is offline.
        *   Restoring a locally saved session works correctly when offline.
        *   Sessions saved offline are persisted locally.

*   **FR4.6 (P0): Offline Sync Handling**
    *   **Description:** When the user comes back online after having made local changes (saves/deletes) while logged in, the extension must automatically sync these changes with the backend.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Maintain a local queue or flag for pending sync operations.
        *   Periodically check for network connectivity.
        *   When connectivity is restored and the user is logged in, process the pending sync queue (upload new/modified sessions, potentially handle deletions).
        *   Implement a basic conflict resolution strategy (e.g., "last write wins" based on timestamp, or always prefer server state upon initial sync after reconnect). For V1, server authoritative after initial sync might be simplest.
    *   **User Story:** As a user who saved several sessions while offline on the train, I expect them to automatically upload to my account once I connect to Wi-Fi at the office.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Local changes made while logged in but offline are detected.
        *   Changes are automatically synced to the backend when connectivity is restored.
        *   Basic conflict handling prevents data loss where possible (though complex conflicts might require user intervention in future versions).

*   **FR4.7 (P0): Unauthenticated Usage**
    *   **Description:** Users who have not signed up or are not logged in can still use the core save/restore functionality locally.
    *   **Implementation:** All save/restore operations act on `chrome.storage.local`. Sync features are disabled or hidden. The extension clearly indicates that sessions are stored locally only and will not be synced.
    *   **User Story:** As a new user trying out the extension, I want to be able to save and restore sessions immediately without needing to create an account first.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Save/restore functionality works fully using local storage when the user is logged out.
        *   The UI makes it clear that sync is not active.
        *   No data is sent to the backend when logged out.

*   **FR4.8 (P0): Session Visibility When Logged Out**
    *   **Description:** Locally saved sessions should remain visible and usable in the extension popup even when the user is logged out.
    *   **Implementation:** The popup UI should always load sessions from `chrome.storage.local` first. If logged in, it can then merge/update this list with data from the backend sync.
    *   **User Story:** As a user who sometimes logs out, I still want to see and use the sessions I saved locally without having to log back in.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Sessions saved while logged in or out are visible in the popup list when the user is logged out.
        *   These local sessions can be restored while logged out.

### 4.5 Security

*   **FR5.1 (P0): Secure Transit**
    *   **Description:** All communication between the browser extension and the backend server must be encrypted using HTTPS.
    *   **Implementation:** The backend server must be configured to only accept HTTPS connections. The extension must make all API calls to `https://` endpoints.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I expect my session data, including potentially sensitive cookies, to be encrypted while traveling between my browser and the service's servers.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Backend enforces HTTPS.
        *   Extension exclusively uses HTTPS URLs for API calls.
        *   Network inspection confirms data is transferred over TLS/SSL.

*   **FR5.2 (P0): Backend Authorization**
    *   **Description:** The backend must implement robust authorization checks to ensure users can only access and modify their *own* saved session data.
    *   **Implementation:** Every backend API endpoint that deals with user-specific data must validate the provided authentication token (e.g., JWT) and ensure the requested resource belongs to the authenticated user ID extracted from the token. Database queries must include `userId` filters.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I need absolute certainty that no other user of Session Sync Pro can ever access my saved sessions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   API endpoints reject requests for data belonging to other users, even with a valid auth token.
        *   Penetration testing (simulated) confirms user data isolation.

*   **FR5.3 (P0): Password Hashing**
    *   **Description:** User passwords must never be stored in plaintext. They must be securely hashed before storing in the database.
    *   **Implementation:** Use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm with a salt, such as `bcrypt` or `Argon2`. Implement this hashing during the signup process and verify passwords during login by hashing the provided password and comparing it to the stored hash.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I expect my account password to be stored securely using industry best practices so that even if the database is compromised, my actual password is not revealed.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Passwords in the MongoDB `users` collection are stored as hashes, not plaintext.
        *   Hashing uses a recognized strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
        *   Login correctly verifies passwords against the stored hashes.

*   **FR5.4 (P0): Rate Limiting**
    *   **Description:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`) and potentially sensitive API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    *   **Implementation:** Use middleware in the Express.js application (e.g., `express-rate-limit`) to limit the number of requests per IP address or user account to sensitive endpoints within a given time window.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I expect the service to have protections against automated attacks trying to guess my password or flood the system.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Excessive login attempts from the same IP are blocked temporarily (e.g., HTTP 429 response).
        *   Rate limits are configured to reasonable levels that don't hinder normal usage.

*   **FR5.5 (P0): Secure Handling of Session Data in Extension**
    *   **Description:** Session data stored locally by the extension (`chrome.storage.local`) should be handled carefully, acknowledging it contains sensitive information.
    *   **Implementation:** While `chrome.storage.local` provides some isolation, avoid exposing raw session data unnecessarily in console logs or error messages. Be mindful of permissions requested.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I trust the extension to handle the sensitive session data it stores locally with care.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   No sensitive session content (cookie values, storage contents) is logged to the browser console during normal operation.
        *   Error handling avoids leaking sensitive data.

*   **FR5.6 (P0): Backend Data Storage (Encryption at Rest - WARNING)**
    *   **Description:** Store session data (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) associated with user accounts in the MongoDB database.
    *   **Implementation:** Session data will be stored in MongoDB documents linked to the `userId`.
    *   **SECURITY WARNING:** The user specification (Q15) indicated *no encryption at rest* for this sensitive data. **This is strongly discouraged and presents a significant security risk.** If the database is compromised, all saved session data (including cookies that might grant direct account access) would be exposed in plaintext. **It is highly recommended to reconsider this requirement and implement field-level encryption or full database encryption for the collections storing session data.** The implementation should proceed as specified *but* this warning must be acknowledged.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I expect my saved sessions to be stored on the backend so I can sync them. (Implicitly, users expect this to be done securely).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Session data is successfully stored in and retrieved from MongoDB.
        *   Data is correctly associated with the `userId`.
        *   (Per user spec, data is NOT encrypted at rest - Acknowledge associated risk).

### 4.6 Permissions

*   **FR6.1 (P0): Browser Permissions**
    *   **Description:** The extension must request the minimum necessary permissions to function correctly and must justify these permissions clearly in the extension store listing.
    *   **Required Permissions:**
        *   `storage`: To store extension settings, local sessions, and user auth tokens.
        *   `cookies`: To read and write cookies for the target domains.
        *   `scripting`: To inject content scripts into pages to access `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` and potentially interact with the page DOM if needed (e.g., for post-restore checks). Requires host permissions.
        *   `activeTab`: Potentially useful for context menu actions, but `<all_urls>` is likely needed for broader functionality.
        *   `contextMenus`: To add the "Save Session" option to the right-click menu.
        *   `alarms`: Potentially for periodic checks (like connectivity) or scheduled syncs.
        *   **Host Permissions:** `<all_urls>`: Required to allow the extension to read/write cookies and inject scripts (`scripting` permission) on any website where the user might want to save/restore a session. This is a broad permission and needs clear justification to the user.
    *   **User Story:** As a user installing the extension, I want to understand why it needs permissions like accessing data on all websites, and trust that it's necessary for the core functionality.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `manifest.json` file correctly declares all necessary permissions.
        *   Permissions requested are the minimum required for the specified features.
        *   Store description clearly explains the need for each permission, especially `<all_urls>`.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **NFR1 (P0): Performance**
    *   Session save/restore operations should feel near-instantaneous (< 1 second).
    *   Extension background processes should consume minimal CPU/memory during idle time.
    *   Sync operations should be efficient and not block the UI excessively.
    *   Popup UI should load quickly.
*   **NFR2 (P0): Reliability**
    *   Extension should function consistently across supported browsers (target latest Chrome/Firefox).
    *   Backend service should have high availability.
    *   Data synchronization should be reliable, minimizing data loss or corruption.
    *   Graceful error handling should prevent crashes.
*   **NFR3 (P0): Usability**
    *   Interface should be intuitive and easy to learn.
    *   User feedback (success, error, status) should be clear and timely.
    *   Common workflows (save, find session, restore) should be simple and require minimal clicks.
*   **NFR4 (P0): Security**
    *   Adhere to all security requirements outlined in FR5.
    *   Protect against common extension vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting in popup/options pages).
    *   Backend should be secure against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    *   **Reiterate Warning:** The lack of encryption at rest (FR5.6) significantly impacts the overall security posture.
*   **NFR5 (P0): Maintainability**
    *   Codebase (extension and backend) must be well-structured, following standard conventions for JS, Express, and Manifest V3.
    *   Code must be well-documented (comments, README).
    *   Use linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) for code consistency.
    *   Clear separation between UI, background logic, and content scripts in the extension.
    *   Clear separation between API routes, controllers, services, and data models in the backend.
*   **NFR6 (P1): Scalability**
    *   Backend infrastructure (Express.js on a suitable host, MongoDB) should be capable of handling a moderate initial user load and allow for future scaling if needed. Database queries should be optimized.

## 6. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Details

*   **Popup Design:**
    *   Clean, simple layout.
    *   Header showing extension name/logo and login status/button.
    *   Main area listing saved sessions, grouped by site.
        *   Each site group header shows domain name.
        *   Each session item shows custom name, favicon, and a "Restore" button. Maybe a "Delete" icon.
    *   "Save Current Session" button prominently displayed when on a valid web page (not disabled site or `chrome://` page).
    *   Link/button to access Settings (for blacklist, etc.).
    *   Status indicator for sync operations.
*   **Context Menu:** Single item: "Session Sync Pro: Save session for this site".
*   **Auth Flow:** Clicking Sign Up/In buttons opens a dedicated tab/window with standard forms for email/password entry. Clear validation messages on forms.
*   **Feedback:** Use toasts or inline messages within the popup for notifications. Avoid disruptive `alert()` calls.

## 7. Technical Specifications

*   **Frontend (Browser Extension):**
    *   **Manifest:** Version 3 (Manifest V3)
    *   **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   **Frameworks/Libraries:** None required, but small utility libraries (like for date formatting or UUID generation) are acceptable if needed. No large UI frameworks (like React/Vue) unless deemed essential for complexity management (keep it simple if possible).
    *   **Storage:** `chrome.storage.local` for local session data, settings, auth token.
    *   **APIs:** `chrome.cookies`, `chrome.scripting`, `chrome.storage`, `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.contextMenus`, potentially `chrome.alarms`.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Express.js (Node.js)
    *   **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js) or TypeScript (preferred for maintainability).
    *   **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM is recommended).
    *   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management after login.
    *   **Password Hashing:** bcrypt.js or equivalent.
*   **Project Structure:**
    *   `session-sync-pro/`
        *   `extension/` (Contains all browser extension code: manifest.json, popup/, background/, content_scripts/, icons/, etc.)
        *   `backend/` (Contains all Express.js backend code: server.js, routes/, controllers/, models/, middleware/, etc.)
        *   `README.md` (Overall project setup, build, run instructions)
        *   `.gitignore`

## 8. Security Considerations Summary

*   **HTTPS:** Mandatory for all client-server communication.
*   **Password Hashing:** Use bcrypt/Argon2 for user passwords.
*   **Authentication:** Use JWTs securely (e.g., short expiry, HTTPS only).
*   **Authorization:** Strict checking on backend to ensure users access only their own data.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect auth endpoints against brute force.
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize/validate all input on both frontend and backend.
*   **Extension Permissions:** Use minimum required permissions, justify `<all_urls>`.
*   **Data Handling:** Avoid logging sensitive data; be mindful of data stored locally.
*   **Encryption at Rest (WARNING):** **Strongly advise implementing encryption at rest for session data stored in MongoDB, despite initial user specification.** Document the chosen approach (or lack thereof) clearly.

## 9. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Network Errors:** Handle failed API calls gracefully (retry mechanisms where appropriate, clear user feedback).
*   **Sync Conflicts:** Implement a basic resolution strategy (e.g., last-write-wins based on timestamp, prompt user if complex).
*   **Storage Limits:** Handle potential `chrome.storage.local` quota limits (though unlikely for session metadata, `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` content could be large). Notify user if storage fails.
*   **Invalid Data:** Handle cases where stored data might be corrupted or in an unexpected format.
*   **API Failures:** Backend should return meaningful error codes/messages; extension should interpret these for user feedback.
*   **Browser/Platform Issues:** Note any known compatibility issues with specific browser versions.
